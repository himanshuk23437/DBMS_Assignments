# DB Lab 5 – SQL JOIN Operations Assignment

## 📘 About the Assignment
This assignment focuses on practicing SQL INNER JOIN queries in Oracle Database. It includes retrieving data from multiple related tables using primary–foreign key relationships, applying table aliases for better readability, filtering records using the WHERE clause, sorting results using ORDER BY, and performing analytical queries using aggregate functions with GROUP BY, without modifying the database tables.

The objective of this lab is to strengthen understanding of relational data retrieval using JOIN operations.
